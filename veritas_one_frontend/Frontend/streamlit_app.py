        At Veritas One, we provide you with a free, unified electronic health record (EMR)—a single place where all your medical data is securely stored, always available, and completely under your control.

        But that’s just the beginning. Unlike other platforms, we empower you to take control of your health data, allowing you to monetize it on your own terms while contributing to groundbreaking medical research and industry innovation.

        We believe your health data is one of your most valuable assets—and you should be the one to control it.

        Most hospitals, insurance companies, and tech companies already collect and use your patient data—but they do it behind closed doors, without compensating you.

        We’re different. We put you in control, allowing you to:

        - **Improve Your Own Healthcare:** Faster, better care – doctors make better decisions when they see your full medical history.
        - **Easier Second Opinions:** No more faxing records or re-explaining your history.
        - **Avoid Duplicate Tests & Procedures:** Save time, money, and unnecessary treatments.
        - **Advance Medicine & Improve Patient Care (If You Choose To):** Help researchers discover new treatments and improve existing ones.
        - **Earn Money From Your Data (Only If You Opt In):** Receive a portion of the profits generated from your data.

        At Veritas One, you own your health data, you control its use, and you benefit from it.

        At Veritas One, we use a three-database system to keep your identifiable and de-identified data separate. This ensures your privacy while still allowing you to benefit from data sharing.

        **Your Personal Health Record (Your Unified EMR - Secure & Private)**
        - **What it includes:**
          - Your entire medical history—lab results, imaging, medications, provider notes, and more.
          - Data from all your past providers, hospitals, and clinics, even across different systems.
          - Ongoing updates—whenever you visit a doctor, your records are automatically updated.
        - **How it helps you:**
          - No more scrambling to track down old records.
          - No more repeating tests because one hospital can’t see what another ordered.
          - A single, comprehensive record helps you get better care.
        - **How it’s used:**
          - For personal use—access, manage, and share your records anytime.
          - For your medical care—share records instantly with doctors or family.
          - For optional personalized opportunities—if you opt in, we can match you with clinical trials, new medications, or exclusive savings.

        **Your De-Identified Data (For Research & Medical Advancements - Always Anonymous)**
        - **What it includes:**
          - Medical conditions, treatments, lab values, and imaging findings (all personal identifiers removed).
        - **Why it matters:**
          - Helps researchers identify trends in diseases and treatment effectiveness.
          - Supports public health efforts.

        **Limited Identifiable Dataset**
        - Your data is already being monetized by others—unlike them, you control your identifiable data and decide whether to opt in for personalized opportunities.

        Our free, unified electronic health record (EMR) platform consolidates your medical data from every provider and hospital into one secure, patient-centered repository.

        What sets us apart is our ethical, patient-first approach to data sharing. You decide how your information is used with three customizable sharing modes:
        - **Strict Privacy Mode:** Your data is for your eyes only.
